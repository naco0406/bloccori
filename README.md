## Summary
South Korea's real estate system is governed by registries, where rights are officially recorded by lawyers and attorneys in a legal process. However, the current Korean registry is a centralized state agency, with the courts managing the registry for the entire country, and there are several problems.

Problem 1. Issues with the credibility of real estate registers A real estate register is an ownership book for real estate, and since all real estate transactions are managed by the government, it seems to have a lot of public credibility. Therefore, many people think that real estate registers are credible, but South Korea does not recognize the credibility of real estate registers under the Civil Code. 

Problem 1-1. The chartering scam, which has become a big issue recently, is also based on this. The charter system is a housing rental system where you leave a deposit and rent someone else's house, and then get your deposit back at the end of the contract period. However, even if you sign a mortgage loan on the same day, the charter takes priority over the mortgage loan, and you may be subject to charter fraud. This exploits a loophole in the law, which states that the lease right starts at 0:00 the next day based on the date of the move-in report and confirmation date, while the mortgage right starts immediately, and the innocent victim is not at fault except for believing the registration.

Problem 2. Registers are public, but there is a cost to view them. As a material of public interest, it should be easily accessible to the public. However, there is a cost associated with accessing the register, and this cost may violate the right of the public to access the register at any time.

Solution 1. Develop an NFT that can update information about real estate in real time, such as when a property is traded, when a lease is signed, or when a move is reported. Of course, there is a problem that the above can be falsified, so we leave it for further implementation.

Solution 2. Once NFTs are available, anyone can view information about NFTs without paying for them. NFTs have a function to look up the status of the NFT, which can be called for free, and you just need to use a website that can display the contents well.
